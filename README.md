# Supercar-Topspeeds
A quick project on calculating and predicting supercar top speeds using today's automotive technology. 

In this project, I use a car top speed dataset from Kaggle, and supplement it with the top speeds of modern supercars that the dataset was missing. 

Project contents in order: 
* Exploratory data analysis and visualization
* Differential equation including drag, weight, power, drivetrain loss, etc to calculate top speed of a vehicle. 
* Using this function to predict the top speeds of the existing supercars, and checking the accuracy of my predictions. 
* Choose best components within reason from each car to create a hypothetical "ideal supercar" using today's technology. 
* Simulate top speed runs of the ideal supercar with a few different conditions.  
* Use logistic regression to calculate the years in which we can expect to see these top speeds achieved assuming we use similar technology (combustion engines, similar aerodynamics, etc). 
* Use linear regression to do the same as above.
